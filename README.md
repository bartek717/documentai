## DocAI

This is an AI enhanced Text Editor which uses TipTap Rich Text Editor, as well as the GPT API to enhance the workflow within text editors

## Motivations

I was sick of constantly needing to open chatGPT when using my text editor, so I'd figure I would make one that had chat within it. I also implemented features to add text files as context to the chat, download as pdf features, and common styling needs.

Feel free to clone the code and use it for yourself (note that I cannot guarentee the longevity of any one feature).
